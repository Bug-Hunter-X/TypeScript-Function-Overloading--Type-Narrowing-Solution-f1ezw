# TypeScript Function Overloading: Type Narrowing

This example demonstrates a frequent issue in TypeScript: attempting to use function overloading, which is not directly supported.  The code initially attempts function overloading, then shows the correct type narrowing solution.

**bug.ts** contains the initial flawed attempt, while **bugSolution.ts** provides the corrected implementation using type narrowing for handling different input types.

This example highlights the importance of understanding TypeScript's type system and employing proper type narrowing techniques for flexible function signatures.
